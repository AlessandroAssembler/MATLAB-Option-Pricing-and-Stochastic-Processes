# MATLAB-Option-Pricing-and-Stochastic-Processes

An excerpt of some of the algorithms in my dissertation focused on random random number generation, 
simulation of discretized stochastic processes, pricing of European, Asian, and barrier options with black and Scholes and SABR model, 
model calibration to extract implied volatility, 
model improvement by variance reduction techniques such as antithetic variables and control variables.

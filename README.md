# MATLAB-Option-Pricing-and-Stochastic-Processes

All the main algorithms (+Thesis corpus PDF) contained in my dissertation focused on:
- random random number generation, 
- simulation of discretized stochastic processes,
- pricing of European, Asian, and barrier options with black and Scholes and SABR model, 
- model calibration to extract implied volatility, 
- model improvement by variance reduction techniques such as antithetic variables and control variables.
